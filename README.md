# watson-discovery-sample
Based on Watson Discovery Python sample script by IBM.
Modified by Tsubasa Kato May 2018

Need some edit of the variable names, as those that need to be edited are same as the original.

Use console.php to launch the ibm_discovery.py file from browser. 
That will display results from the Watson Discovery by calling the python script from console.php.
